                    In fact, most of the troubles of a person are all their own. To say a thousand and ten thousand, it is still inseparable from the three words of greed, jealousy and obsession. To put it bluntly, it is to force.

                    Fame, wealth, rights, status, and love are all things that everyone wants. Getting these things is not just hard work, but also luck. When the providence is not timely, the insistence is to add trouble to yourself.

                    You have a salary of 5,000 dollars per month, but you want to buy a house in the bustling streets of New York. If you can't achieve it, you won’t be happy every day. This is not an ambition; This is what you struggle with yourself.

                    In people’s life, there are many things cannot be done, many dreams that cannot be realized, and many people who leave you alone. Forcing and entanglement will only make you physically and mentally exhausted. It’s better to let it go and calmly face what you lose.

                The German poet Goethe said that the greatest sin of mankind is not happy. Even if it is murder, robbery, or any crime, it is actually caused by people who are not happy. Therefore, the prerequisite for making everything better is happiness.

                Don't put so much pressure on yourself all the time, just do your best to do everything you can. If you have pursued it and you still can't get it, it is no harm to give up.
